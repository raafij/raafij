## Hello there! 👋🏽

Welcome to my life as a business analytics student in Boston, MA. I am a joker/trader by day and coder/gamer by night. I have recently updated my GitHub profile in search of collaboration with fellow individuals/organizations to expand my knowledge of this huge field and further my passion into business analytics/intelligence. 

### My top skillsets

1. 🐍 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. 🏴‍☠️ R (Tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, broom, reshape2)
3. 🌊 SQL (creating scripts, views, procedures when manipulate data from databases)
4. 📊 Tableau (creating vizualizations that efficiently convey information to the average reader)

Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.github.com/raafij/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raafijahangir/">LinkedIn</a> to learn more about me. I'd be more than happy to have a conversation!
