## Hello there! 👋🏽

Welcome to my life as a business analytics student in Boston, MA. I am a social butterfly by day and coder/gamer by night. I have recently updated my GitHub profile in search of collaboration with fellow individuals/organizations to expand my knowledge of this huge field and further my passion into business analytics/intelligence. 

### My skillsets

#### Python
-> NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### R
-> Tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, readr, broom, reshape2

#### SQL
-> creating scripts, views, procedures when manipulate data from databases

#### Tableau
-> creating vizualizations that efficiently convey information to the average reader

Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.github.com/raafij/">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raafijahangir/">LinkedIn</a> to learn more about me. I'd be more than happy to have a conversation!
